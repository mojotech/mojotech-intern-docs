### Slides

 * [2020 Internship Kickoff](/slides/2020-internship.html)
 * [2021 Internship Kickoff](/slides/2021-internship.html)

### What we have

 * 8 week planned internship starting June 1.
  * This will likely mean there is not enough time for an usefull onboard onto helios
  * 2 weeks onboarding onto main project
  * 6 weeks sprints on main project
 * Slack channel for intern help and discussion, #internship. Mentors can be added/removed from @help-interns group to be pinged for help versus passively watching.
 * Markdown docs on netlify. You're looking at it. These cover basic set up, helios, and project ideas. Submit PRs on github.
 * White boarding with video conf through limnu.com. Ping @craigb, @thedelchop, or @gerald to be added.
 * ~~An introductory project for full stack web dev, helios.~~ Likely not enough time.
 * A main project for the intern team, unnamed meeting prep tool.
 * https://missing.csail.mit.edu/ is a great starting point for onboarding

### What we are planning

 * Daily meetup for checkin, code review, or concept discussion. Ideally one of these a week would introduce a new topic (git rebasing, functional programming, shell tooling, RDBMS, etc). The rest could be informal to discuss / share or just chat socially. Hallway may work this.
  * git intro
  * git rebasing intro
  * how to review PRs
  * how to point stories
  * soft skills
    * how to research a new topic
    * how to ask good questions
    * how to know you're stuck
    * how to pair program
 * Mentor stand up. Optional so don't feel obligated to join it unless you want to share or hear what is being worked on (cognizant that everyone is busy).
 * Pair programming. https://tuple.app/ but its Mac only :(

### How you can help

 * Participate in #internship. More mentors mean the interns get help sooner and get to connect with more mojos.
 * Review onboarding steps. We ran into some issues with nvm/rvm and need mac users to verify.
 * Review docs. Find issues or areas for improvement.
 * Topics/presentations for the weekly session. Think a shorter, introductory Friday tech talk.
 * PM and designer for the two projects.

### FAQ

 * Why #internship when we already have #engineering?

   We noticed the interns from previous years were hesitant to post in #engineering and their own channel seemed to help team cohesion.

 * Why limnu when slack already supports drawing on a screen share?

   The limnu white board is persistent (potentially reusuable between years), collaborative (multiple users can draw simultaneously), and offers more functionality. Slack screen share may still be good enough for pair programming.

 * Why write these docs in a custom svelte app?

   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
