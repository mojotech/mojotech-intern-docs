### Save 58

**Inspiration**: [Kurzgesagt â€“ In a Nutshell: This Video Might Save 58 Lives Next Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTx-GSF3cts&rco=1)

**Hypothesis**: Can an automated message (email, tweet, slack, video) save lives?

**Premise**: Can providing statistically likely causes for death or injury for a specific person's demographic (age, gender, profession) combined with current conditions (date, geography, weather) result in that person being mindful of the particular danger to save their life?

Pros:
* This is a deceptively hard problem involving multi dimensional. big data. It could easily keep intern teams occupied for several years
* Decomposable. Its possible to focus this project into smaller, month long deliverables that are challenging.
* Motivational mission. It feels good to do some good.
* Potentially marketable as doing good

Cons:
* Delicate topics for the work place. See the video.
* Not profitable without turning people into the product.
