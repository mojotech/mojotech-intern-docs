### What we have

 * 12 week planned internship starting May 17th
  * 4 weeks onboarding onto helios
  * 8 weeks sprints on main project
 * Slack channel for intern help and discussion, #internship. Mentors can be added/removed from @help-interns group to be pinged for help versus passively watching.
 * Markdown docs on netlify. You're looking at it. These cover basic set up, helios, and project ideas. Submit PRs on github.
 * An introductory project for full stack web dev, helios.
 * Pairing onto a client project
  * Systra
  * United Way
 * https://missing.csail.mit.edu/ is a great starting point for onboarding

### What we are planning

 * Standups for checkin, code review, or concept discussion. Ideally one of these a week would introduce a new topic (git rebasing, functional programming, shell tooling, RDBMS, etc). The rest could be informal to discuss / share or just chat socially. Hallway may work this.
  * git intro
  * git rebasing intro
  * how to review PRs
  * how to point stories
  * soft skills
    * how to research a new topic
    * how to ask good questions
    * how to know you're stuck
    * how to pair program
 * Mentor stand up. Optional so don't feel obligated to join it unless you want to share or hear what is being worked on (cognizant that everyone is busy).
 * Pair programming. LiveShare in Visual Code

### How you can help

 * Participate in #internship. More mentors mean the interns get help sooner and get to connect with more mojos.
 * Review onboarding steps. We ran into some issues with nvm/rvm and need mac users to verify.
 * Review docs. Find issues or areas for improvement.
 * Topics/presentations for the weekly session. Think a shorter, introductory Friday tech talk.
 * PM and designer for the two projects.

### FAQ

 * Why #internship when we already have #engineering?

   We noticed the interns from previous years were hesitant to post in #engineering and their own channel seemed to help team cohesion.

 * Why write these docs in a custom svelte app?

   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
